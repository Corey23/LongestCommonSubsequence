# LongestCommonSubsequence
C++ Trivial and Non-trivial implementation of Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm with two arrays.

* **Custom Longest Common Subsequence Class**
    * This is a custom class created in "LongestCommonSubsequence.h"
    * The default constructor takes parameters to set the two character arrays and their respective sizes
    * There are two other functions in this class. The first of the two uses the data members set in the constructor

* **Trivial Implementation**
    * The length of the longest common subsequence is obtained by using recursion
    * Recursion
